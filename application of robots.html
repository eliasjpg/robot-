          <p>Military robots,Industrial robots.</p>  
             Robots are increasingly used in manufacturing (since the 1960s). According to the Robotic Industries Association US data, in 2016 automotive industry was the main customer of industrial robots with 52% of total sales. in the auto industry, they can amount for more than half of the "labor". There are even "lights off" factories such as an IBM keyboard manufacturing factory in Texas that was fully automated as early as 2003.

             can be separated into three types: traditional robots, robotic arm, and robotic exoskeleton.
           <P> Agricultural robots (AgRobots).</P>
             The use of robots in agriculture is closely linked to the concept of AI-assisted precision agriculture and drone usage.1996-1998 research also proved that robots can perform a herding task.</p>
